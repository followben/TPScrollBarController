# TPScrollBarController

####A custom container view controller for iOS 5.

TPScrollBarController is functionally similar to UITabBarController

However the tab bar scrolls (yay!) and bar items are fully customisable UIButtons (rather than UITabBarItems).

## Usage

Take a look at the "ScrollBarExample" project for a worked example. Open the project in Xcode 4.2 and build and run to see it in action.

Fairly basic, but it suits my needs. Maybe it will yours too :)
