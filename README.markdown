# TPScrollBarController

### A custom container view controller for iOS5. Like UITabBarController, except the tab bar scrolls (yay!) and bar items are fully customisable UIButtons rather than UITabBarItems.

## Usage

See the "ScrollBarExample" app for a worked example.

Fairly rudimentary at present, but it suits my needs. Maybe it will yours too :)
